## Project Summary

Our web app is a shared expense and debt management system designed to help friends efficiently track, split, and settle money owed within social circles. Our users will be able to record transactions that allow them to view real-time net balances between members, reducing confusion about who owes what. This system will model debts relationally, representing the relationships between users as structured connections that reflect outstanding debts. By organizing debt and transaction data within social circles clearly and consistently, our app will provide users with the confidence to front expenses for their friends without hesitation.
