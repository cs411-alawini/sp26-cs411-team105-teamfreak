## Revisions
We made two revisions to our initial stage 1. For our creative component we did not want to completely change it, so instead we added another. We will create a scoring system based on metadata that will score users 0-100. This scoring system is determinant on different factors similar to a credit score and is detailed in the updated proposal. This new component adds another layer of technical difficulty as well as provides a feature not offered in similar apps. Secondly, after consulting course staff in office hours we will be using generative AI to create our datasets. The sections affected by these changes are creative component, usefulness, and realness.
